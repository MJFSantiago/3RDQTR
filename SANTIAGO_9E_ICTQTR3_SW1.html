The beast mode of EVA-02 is a mode that can be activated by the pilot, Asuka Langley Soryu, during moments of extreme emotional stress or trauma. When the beast mode is activated, EVA-02 becomes uncontrolled and violent, attacking anything and everything in its path. The beast mode grants the Eva tremendous physical strength and endurance, but at the cost of its sanity and humanity. It is a dangerous and uncontrollable state that can have devastating consequences, not only for the target, but also for those nearby. The beast mode is a last resort for the pilot, only to be used when all other weapons have failed, and the pilot has run out of options. The beast mode is similar to the berserker mode of EVA-01 but with its own unique features, such as a horn that can stab and impale its enemies. The beast mode is extremely dangerous and should only be used as a last resort. <br>  <button> DEPLOY </button></td>
